 * ── There is no menu here, and that is the whole design ────────────────────
 *
 * This file carried two mega-menus, a mobile sheet with its own focus trap and
 * scroll lock, roving-tabindex keyboard handlers for both, and a 27-icon lucide
 * map — around 750 lines. Every one of them read from `megaMenus`,
 * `directLinks` or `mobileOrder` in src/data/nav.ts, and all three have been
 * empty arrays since the page became a waitlist. The sheet was further gone
 * than that: no trigger was ever rendered for it, so `setMobileOpen(true)` had
 * no call site and the dialog could not open at any viewport.
 *
 * Navigation exists to help a reader choose between destinations. There are no
 * destinations — one scroll, four sections, ending at the form it started
 * with — so what the bar owes the reader is the mark and the action, and the
 * action only once the hero's copy of it has scrolled away.
 *
 * If a second destination ever arrives, the menu is in this file's history, not
 * in its source. A component that renders nothing is not a feature in waiting.

                  rather than luminance. Measured, accent #FF9E7A has relative
                  luminance 0.4712 and chrome #AEAEB2 has 0.4249 — 1.0976:1 taken
                  as a contrast pair, so there is no brightness step between them.
                  What separates them is OKLCH chroma 0.1263 against 0.0057, a gap
                  of 22.16x, plus 245.23 deg of hue. The rule the page enforces is
                  "only the action is saturated copper", so a mark beside a live
                  control is neutral steel — DESIGN.md §4. §23 splits it by
                  context and sends this case to chrome; the footer wordmark is
                  the other case, and that one IS copper.

                  What sat here before was a `chrome` tile containing lucide's
                  `TrendingUp`. A rising arrow is a returns claim, forbidden in as
                  many words by the spec's product constraints — and this page
                  carries a SEBI market-risk disclosure one scroll below. The real
                  mark needs no tile: a ring with a trail is already a shape.

                  36 in a 64px bar and 40 in an 80px one, i.e. 0.4375 and 0.425 of
                  the bar — the spec's own proportion rather than an eyeballed
                  size. It matters more here than it would for a filled glyph:
                  this mark is an outline ring plus two dots, so it carries far
                  less ink per unit area, and under-sized it reads optically
                  lighter than the wordmark it is supposed to lead. `small`
                  thickens the ring from 2 to 2.3 units, which is what holds its
                  weight against the word. */}
