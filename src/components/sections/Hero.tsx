/**
 * §2 Hero — full-bleed clip with the copy and the phone field on top of it.
 *
 * The hero CONTAINS the conversion rather than linking to it. The ask is a phone
 * number and the cost of giving it is a fortnightly message, so a reader already
 * convinced by the offer should not have to scroll four sections to act on it.
 *
 * Two rules govern the opening motion:
 *
 *  - The headline settles out of a blur, a line at a time, while the field
 *    behind it resolves. This is the page's one authored motion moment.
 *  - Nothing rises. The motion damps DOWNWARD into place, because
 *    docs/motion-brief.md §7 reads upward motion on a broker page as a claim
 *    about returns.
 *
 * The settle is CSS (`.hero-settle-*` in index.css), driven by nothing but the
 * delay each line carries. It used to be a React state flip — mounted settled,
 * unsettled in an effect, settled again two frames later — and that stopped
 * working the moment the page began arriving prerendered: the headline was
 * already on screen and finished, so the effect took it back to opacity 0 and
 * played the intro a second time, seconds late. Worse, whether the reader saw
 * that depended on their engine. WebKit painted the collapse; Chromium batched
 * it away. In CSS the animation belongs to the element the HTML delivered, so
 * it runs exactly once, at first paint, before any script has loaded, and
 * hydration cannot restart it.
 *
 * The headline is split on `\n`, so it animates whatever lines the string
 * produces — the current copy carries no breaks and wraps on its own.
 *
 * The market-risk disclosure sits in an opaque rail at the foot of the section:
 * mandatory, visible in the first viewport, never collapsed, never behind a
 * blur.
