              here is the colour those sentences render in. (`FinalCta` passes a
              `Disclosure`, which sets its own and overrides this by
              inheritance.)

              White at 55% composites to #919090 over the new ground: 6.275:1,
              chroma 0.0012. `fg-subtle` is 5.3087:1 on bg and 4.7179:1 on the
              raised surface — a real drop, and it is the right trade twice over.
              First, this text is read directly beside body copy set in `fg-muted`
              at chroma 0.0078, and a dead-neutral grey next to a warm one is the
              cool-patch defect the whole palette moved to avoid. Second, an
              alpha's contrast is a property of whatever it lands on, and this
              slot always lands on a media plate under a scrim — so the 6.275:1
              was never the number that rendered.

              THE HALF OF THAT ARGUMENT THAT WAS WRONG, corrected rather than
              trimmed, because it pointed the wrong way. It said "5.3087:1 is a
              floor the token guarantees". It is not a floor, it is a CEILING:
              5.3087:1 is the value on `bg`, and every surface this slot can
              actually sit on is lighter than `bg`, so the token can only go
              down from there — 5.0620:1 on `surface`, 4.7179:1 on
              `surface-raised`, and on a lit plate it goes under 4.5:1. Swapping
              an alpha for a token buys a number that is COMPUTABLE, not one
              that is guaranteed.

              So here is the constraint with its number, which is what the claim
              should have been. `fg-subtle` holds 4.5:1 only while the pixel
              behind it stays below relative luminance Y 0.0120 — about neutral
              #1D1D1D. Measured on the rendered page at 1920/1440/1024/768/390,
              the brightest pixel under any glyph in this slot is #0A0909 and the
              worst ratio is 5.2846:1, so it holds today with ~11% of headroom in
              contrast terms; `PendingField`'s own lit face #251E1B would put it
              at 4.3588:1, which is the margin this slot is working inside.
              `FinalCta` states the same constraint from the plate's side (its
              scrim puts the ceiling at plate grey 89, 4.5071:1) and that is the
              form to copy: the plate is the variable, the token is not.

              It clears 4.5:1 at this 13px size on every surface it renders on.
              `Platform` made this exact move for its deck and states the same
              second reason.
