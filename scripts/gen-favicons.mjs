// Generates every favicon — .ico, PNGs and the SVG — from one source:
// scripts/assets/thinq-mark.svg.
//
// ── Ground: transparent in the tab, opaque on a home screen ────────────────
//
// The tab icons are the bare mark on transparency. Two problems followed from
// that, both now fixed, recorded so neither is reintroduced:
//
//   - The mark is a silver-to-white gradient. On a dark tab strip it reads
//     beautifully. On a LIGHT tab strip — the default in Chrome, Safari and
//     Firefox — only the #a0a0a5 and #b0b0b5 stops carried, so the ring read as
//     partial rather than solid.
//   - Safari composites favicon transparency onto WHITE rather than onto the
//     tab, so in Safari specifically the light-strip case above is the only
//     case: it is white ground there even in dark mode.
//
// This was previously an opaque #050505 tile for exactly those reasons. The
// plate around the mark was the more visible problem, so the ground went; the
// washout was then fixed the way the note here always said it should be — with
// a darker mark, not a plate behind it. See LIGHT_INK.
//
// ── Why there are two of every tab icon ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The first attempt at that gave the SVG an internal
// `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)` rule and let it ink itself. It did not
// work: Chrome rasterises an SVG favicon in a context that reports the LIGHT
// scheme no matter what the system is set to, so the rule fired always and the
// mark was near-black in dark mode too — the icon looked black on a black tab
// strip. Firefox honours it; Chrome does not, and Chrome is most of the traffic.
//
// So the scheme is resolved OUTSIDE the file instead. Each icon is emitted
// twice — near-black for a light strip, the silver gradient for a dark one —
// and index.html gates the pair with `media` on the `<link rel="icon">`, which
// both engines do evaluate against the real system theme and re-evaluate when
// it changes. Neither file carries a media query of its own; a static file
// whose colour is chosen by the markup cannot be second-guessed by the renderer.
//
// The launcher icons stay OPAQUE #050505 (= `--color-bg` in src/index.css and
// the document's `theme-color`). iOS applies its own mask and composites
// transparency onto black, and Android launchers mask too, so a transparent
// icon there produces a black plate we did not choose instead of one we did.
//
// Run: npm run favicons
